    <p>Monkeys are tree-dwelling (arboreal) simians. They are in the primate order. Monkeys are intelligent, social animals. Most monkeys have a tail, even if it is a short one.</p>
     <p>The word "monkey" is a common-language term which is not used in taxonomy. It includes two rather different groups of primates. The big distinction is between Old World monkeys and New World monkeys. Some examples of monkeys are macaques, baboons, guenons and marmosets
        Old World monkeys: Cercopithecidae. Apes are the descendants of Old World monkeys.[4]
        New World Monkeys: Platyrrhini or Ceboidea (same thing in effect)
        Both these groups are in the infraorder Simiiformes. That infraorder also includes the great apes and man.
        Some monkeys live almost entirely in trees. Others live partly on the ground. Monkeys are mainly vegetarian, with a strong preference for fruit. However, they may eat a wide range of other food, including insects. Monkeys can live in forests and savannahs, but not in deserts. Some can live in snowy mountains, but more live in rainforests. There are none in the rainforests of Australia and New Guinea. Apparently they never reached those islands.</p>
   <p>Some monkeys are small, about 15 centimetres (6 in) long and 120 grams (4.2 oz) in weight. Other monkeys are much larger, about 1 metre (3 ft 3 in) long and 35 kilograms (77 lb) in weight. A group of monkeys is called a "troop" of monkeys or a "tribe" of monkeys.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the monkey at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
